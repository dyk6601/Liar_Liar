const TIPS = [
  "Use specific, single-word clues to avoid ambiguity.",
  "Avoid mentioning words that are too close to the secret word.",
  "When guessing, listen for patterns in the clues across players.",
  "If you're the liar, stay consistent with the group's topic to avoid suspicion.",
  "Don't volunteer extra information—answer succinctly.",
  "Watch body language and hesitation when others speak.",
  "Tie your clues to common experiences (e.g., 'kitchen', 'travel') to narrow options.",
  "If unsure, ask follow-up clarifying questions rather than making wild guesses.",
  "Rotate who gives clues each round to keep the game fair and fun.",
  "Use contrasts (opposites) to steer others away from the real word if you're lying."
